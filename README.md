This is an image filtering app which I have written as my graduation project.

Project consists of:
-Filtering app in which all the filtering algorithms had been implemented. Can be used from the command line.
-Backend application which is responsible for communication with the browser app and the server. It calls the filtering app as a child process.
-Frontend app, which works as a GUI
-Single table MySQL database, which stores registered users with their password hashes

Technologies used:
-JavaScript
-React
-Express.js
-C (for multithreaded algorithms)
